Pseudo-code for Polymorphism in processPayment

1. Define method processPayment()
2. Implement processPayment differently in each Payment class
   - UPI → Print success message with UPI ID
   - Card → Print success message with masked card number
   - NetBanking → Print success message with bank name
3. Same method name, different behaviors
4. Output: Action depends on payment type
