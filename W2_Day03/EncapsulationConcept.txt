Pseudo-code for Encapsulation in Payment Classes

1. Create separate Payment classes (UPI, Card, NetBanking)
2. Each class contains attributes specific to its type
   - UPI → UPI ID
   - Card → Card number, expiry date
   - NetBanking → Bank name, account number
3. Keep attributes private
4. Provide methods to access data securely
5. Output: Secure data handling per payment type
