Pseudo-code for Extensibility in Payment System

1. System currently supports UPI, Card, NetBanking
2. To add new payment mode (Wallet, Crypto, etc.):
   - Create new Payment class with its attributes
   - Implement processPayment() method
   - Plug into Transaction<T>
3. Existing code remains unchanged
4. Output: Flexible and extendable system design
